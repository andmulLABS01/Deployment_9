# Ecom application deployment on AWS network with EKS
# November 18, 2023

## Purpose

The primary goal of this deployment is to leverage Kubernetes to deploy a robust e-commerce application within the AWS network. Automation is introduced by Terraform and Jenkins to streamline the provisioning of the application's architecture. To enhance security, the applicationâ€™s containers are launched in private subnets. Workload distribution and accessibility are ensured through the deployment of a load balancer. Configuration details, such as accessible ports and desired states, are declared in YAML files.

This setup aims to establish a resilient and scalable infrastructure for the e-commerce application, optimizing performance and scalability during traffic spikes, and addressing disaster recovery scenarios.

## Jenkins Infrastructure (EC2.tf)
The infrastructure for Jenkins is defined in the [ec2.tf](jenkinsenv/ec2.tf) file. This infrastructure consists of three EC2 instances:

1. **Jenkins Manager**: This instance is responsible for managing and controlling the worker nodes.
2. **Docker Node / Terraform**: This node is equipped for tasks such as testing the application, building the Docker image, and pushing the image to Docker Hub. Terraform then provisioned the application infrastructure 
3. **EKS Node**: This Jenkins node handles the creation of the EKS cluster and the application's EKS worker nodes. The configuration is based on the deployment, service, and ingress YAML files.

[Scripts](Jenkins_files) have been prepared to install the necessary files on each instance.
