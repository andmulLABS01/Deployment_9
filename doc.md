# Ecom application deployment on AWS network with EKS
# November 18, 2023

## Purpose

The primary goal of this deployment is to leverage Kubernetes to deploy a robust e-commerce application within the AWS network. Automation is introduced by Terraform and Jenkins to streamline the provisioning of the application's architecture. To enhance security, the applicationâ€™s containers are launched in private subnets. Workload distribution and accessibility are ensured through the deployment of a load balancer. Configuration details, such as accessible ports and desired states, are declared in YAML files.

This setup aims to establish a resilient and scalable infrastructure for the e-commerce application, optimizing performance and scalability during traffic spikes, and addressing disaster recovery scenarios.
